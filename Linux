PRACTICAL NO.3
A) Create a user xyz, a group g1 using commands and add user xyz to group g1.
• useradd xyz → used to add user “xyz”
• passwd xyz → used to set password for user xyz
• groupadd g1 → used to create group with name “g1”

2) /data/support
change the group ownership of these directories to group g1.
• mkdir -p /data/sales /data/support → to create directories with complete path
• -p → complete path name
• chgrp g1 /data/sales /data/support → to change the group ownership of directories form root
user to group “g1”

ln -s → to create symbolic link
ln → to create hard link
D) Create a backup of files and folders
du → disk uses
-sh → show disk uses in human readable format
gzip → to reduce the size of the file
tar -cvf back.tar → used to create a tar archive named back.tar and add the files f1, f2, and f3 to it.
 tar: This is the tar command, which is used to create and manipulate tar archives.
 -c: This option tells tar to create a new archive.
 -v: This option tells tar to be verbose, meaning it will print information about the files being added to the archive.
 -f: This option specifies the name of the archive file to be created.

PRACTICAL NO.6
A) Mount and unmount USB flash drives using commands
Connect a USB drive to your device → In RHEL select “Connect to a virtual machine” and the name of the virtual
machine → click “OK”
Now the USB drive has been mounted on your virtual machine
df → This command will show information about all mounted file systems
mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 t → to mount the file system on the device /dev/sdb1 to the directory t.

Go to Computer → Filesystem → var →spool → mail
There you can see the mail received from the tyit user to the root user

PRACTICAL NO.8
A) Configure Apache web server
rpm -qa | grep http : used to check whether the http packages are installed or not.
Then use chkconfig httpd on to on the httpd service
Use gedit sample.html to create an html file for execution.
After the sample.html is edited we need to restart the http service using service httpd restart
Now go to Application→ Internet→ Konqueror to open the browser.
Copy paste the file path to the browser search and execute the file.
B) Write a script monitor activity on Apache web server, script should also start the
Apache web server if it is not running.
Use gedit test.sh to create shell file.
Create a program to run counter infinitely using while loop
ps aux: process status for all user processes
grep http: to find all the files related to http
grep -v grep > /dev/null: to redirect all the errors to the null folder in device folder
Open another terminal to stop httpd service

PRACTICAL NO .9.
AIM: Setting up a Samba server
First go to RHEL_6.0 Disk and install samba packages
“rpm -ivh samba*” command is used to directly install the samba packages through terminal
Now check the installed samba packages
Right Click on communication icon → Edit Connections
Click “Add”
Go to IPv4 Settings and select “Manual” Method
Click on “Add” and add the Addresses → Click on “Apply” button to apply the network settings
Now check whether the Network is added or not using “ifconfig” command
If ip address is not set then use “ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 up”
command. Then use “ifconfig” command to check the ip address
Now next step:
Go to “Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections → click on” and
perform the steps in the Windows operating system
Click on “OK” to save all the changes.
Now go to VMWare and perform the following :
Use CTRL + D to Save the file edited using “cat” command
Now change the permissions of the files created in tyit folder
Now use “vim /etc/samba/smb.conf” command to edit the configuration file
Without going in insert mode use “:set nu” command in command mode (to set numbers in file)
Now scroll down and go to number 74 and edit “MYGROUP” to “WORKGROUP” on number 79 remove the semi colon “;” and change the ip addresses
On line number 80 remove ; & change the ip address to allow the number of users
Now copy the contents of from line number 282 to to 288 and paste them on the next line.
Then make changes to the code
testparm → to test parameters
setenforce 0 → gives temporary read only permission
getsebool -a | grep samba → to check properties
setsebool → to set properties
Now start and restart the smb services
Now add a new user “test” and set password “test” (to avoid confusion). Then restart the smb services
smbclient //192.168.1.3/home/tyit -U test → to send the complete tyit directory to the user
Once the smb services are start now we will start the network services
Service nmb start → to start the network services
Now go to Windows → open “run” → enter “ping 192.168.1.3 -t” (ip address of linux machine)
ping → used to check the connection between the linux and windows operating system
if the connection is established, the output will be as given below and if the connection is not established then “request timeout” will be displayed
-t → for testing the connection

PRACTICAL NO.10
Aim: Configure DHCP Server in Linux.
• First go to RHEL_6.0 Disk and install DHCP packages 
• Check whether the DHCP package is installed or not and check the Hostname. 
• setup  shows network configuration window 
• select “Network configuration”  “Device configuration”  select the device 
• Remove the “*” from use DHCP, to remove the “*” press spacebar, then enter the IP addresses 
• Press tab key and enter to save the changes 
ifdown eth0  to disable network connection
• ifup eth0  to enable network connection 
• If the ip address is not activated or deactivated using the terminal then use the following steps:
• Go to wired networks  VPN Connections  Configure VPN  Select “Wired”  Click on
“System eth0”  click “Edit” 
• Go to IPv4 Settings and perform the changes 
• Or else use “ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.0 up” command to activate the
network connection
• Copy file and then paste is to another location
• Go to Computer > Filesystem > usr > share >doc > dhcp-4.1.1 >
• :set nu > to set numbers to the configuration file
• Change the domain name on line number 7, on line number 8 add the new domain, and remove
the comment on line number 8. 
• Comment line 27 and 28 
• Assign the subnet and netmask addresses, set the range for DHCP addresses, and comment out
the line number 34 
Save and quit the vim editor
